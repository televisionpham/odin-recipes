    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Monkey bread is a pull-apart bread made with bite-size pieces of dough coated with sugar and spice and baked with
        a buttery brown sugar sauce in a tube or Bundt pan. To serve monkey bread, invert it onto a large plate and let
        everyone pull it apart into individual pieces with their fingers or forks.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Biscuit dough: This recipe uses cut-up pieces of canned biscuit dough as a convenient shortcut ingredient.
        </li>
        <li>Sugar and cinnamon: Used to coat biscuit dough pieces both for flavor and to make them easier to pull apart
            after baking. You can substitute other ground spices such as cardamom or a pumpkin spice blend.</li>
        <li>Walnuts (optional): You could substitute pecans or leave out the nuts altogether.</li>
        <li>Raisins (optional): You could substitute dried cranberries or other small bits of dried fruit.</li>
        <li>Margarine and brown sugar: Combined and briefly boiled to create the sweet caramel-like sauce that holds the
            monkey bread together. Many reviewers use butter instead of margarine. Be sure to pack down the brown sugar
            firmly into the measuring cup to get the correct amount. Some home cooks recommend adding about Â¼ cup cream
            or milk to help keep the sauce soft even after it cools.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the biscuits into quarters and coat in cinnamon-sugar.</li>
        <li>Arrange the pieces in the pan. Add the raisins and nuts among the pieces if you're using them.</li>
        <li>Boil the brown sugar and margarine, then pour over the biscuits.</li>
        <li>Bake the monkey bread in the preheated oven.</li>
    </ol>
